<p>I propose the following to possibly enhance the detection of non randomness in quantum fluctuations generating electronic noise that could evolve to detection of something beyond the human state of being.</p>

<p>In short:<br/>
Use many small avalanche breakdown zener diodes to get a high electric field, many localized measurements and a high initial amplification .</p>

<p>Digitize the entire noise waveform from the zener diodes.</p>

<p>Use a genetic algorithm that evolves populations of neural networks to detect correlations between the many noise channels depending on outside events like an operator wishes to move a point on the screen to the left, down, up or down. But the events can of course be as many and varied as the other events that true random number generators have been used to detect anomalies in.</p>

<hr/><p>Is it only the genome that codes the structure of the brain so that scientific theories always gets better and better or is it a far more advanced continuous coding in the form of ordered quantum fluctuations from an invisible realm in the brain, though together with the brain resulting from the genome, that are mostly responsible for the fact that scientific theories are getting better and better all the time or is it something else? If it is only the genome that are responsible for scientific theories always getting better and better, how do one account for, that none of the best computer programmers are even close to building a machine that by itself can improve science? Is natural selection on events seemingly unrelated to modern science really that powerful in shaping the genome, so that the genome by itself can improve scientific theories?</p>

<p>Why can the supposed code in the genome that make scientific theories better and better all the time, not make a similar code elsewhere? Changes in computer code can be made much more rapidly than what have been done in the genome, Random or guided, but no group of programmers have succeeded in making very powerful AI able to by itself to make better and better scientific theories. I say that perhaps such a powerful code that can make scientific theories better and better by itself that has a size less than 3 GB maybe can not exist neither in the genome or elsewhere. I propose an experiment to investigate whether order in quantum fluctuations originating from an invisible realm maybe are responsible for scientific theories getting better all the time:</p>

<p>I think that a brain can not make better and better scientific theories without some careful guidance in how the neurons and synapses are growing. A negligent or absent control with the growing and deletion of neurons and synapses will invariably lead to scientific theories getting more and more incorrect due to the fact that there are many more wrong theories than correct ones, I hold. That control that I hold is needed must come from the genome if not from elsewhere outside a brain defined to be following the already known natural laws and not much else.</p>

<p>Then if it is so, why is something similar not witnessed in computers, that can mutate a genome that defines a neural network simulated in a computer, thousands of times each second and make some evaluation of the result. Much faster than what is happening in the genomes of humans where some mutations happens once every 20 years or so where after the result is undergoing some evaluation.</p>

<p>I am not convinced that faster computers will change this.</p>

<p>I do not think that the control on how Einsteins brain developed were negligent or absent. Einstein by the way could not accept that quantum fluctuations were random.</p>

<p>The next shock came in 1926 when Max Born proposed that mechanics were to be understood as a probability without any causal explanation.</p>

<p>Einstein rejected this interpretation. In a 1926 letter to Max Born, Einstein wrote: "I, at any rate, am convinced that He [God] does not throw dice."</p>

<p>Bells inequality could rule out maybe all kinds of fixed hidden variables created together with the particles if there is no non locality. The measurements confirming non locality do NOT RULE OUT ALL KINDS OF DYNAMICALLY CHANGING NONLOCAL HIDDEN VARIABLES IF ONE LIKE, that are changing in a non random way, sometimes at least maybe partly controlled by a supreme intelligence refereed to as God by Albert Einstein, or other intelligences I think? The questions to me is: What else could improve scientific theories over time?</p>

<p>Bell's theorem states:<br/>
No physical theory of local hidden variables can ever reproduce all of the predictions of quantum mechanics.</p>

<hr/><p>I can understand why order can increase in a genome so that the the best swimmer in water can evolve, because the somewhat random mutations and recombinations in new beings of a particular species will tend to favor those that can swim better using a minimum of energy. The genomes that give better swimmers will be passed on more and the nucleotide base pairs that gives bad swimmers will not be copied so much since the bearers of such nucleotides in their genome will get less offspring. The same with the IQ in humans in some environments. Later when we can synthesize DNA cheaply this process of getting better genomes could speed up tremendously.</p>

<p>But I can’t understand how the scientific theories for instance in physics  are getting better and better in a generation. Natural selection in the genome don’t work in such a small periods of time. What principle removes the more wrong scientific views  and spreads the more correct scientific views in the brains of scientists and lay people so that science and technology evolves within a generation of 20 years for instance? Neural networks alone does not seem capable of that? I have never seen an explanation that should make them able to do so.</p>

<p>It can for instance not be by the process of the scientists with the wrong views dying before the scientists with the correct views. Since the scientific theories improve within the the time span of a single generation.</p>

<p>There are many more wrong scientific theories, than more correct ones. Should the second law of thermodynamics not prevent better and better theories of becoming dominant? And then add to the neural networks the, according to theory, completely random quantum fluctuations. Then better and better scientific theories seems even more impossible.</p>

<p>I have never seen an explanation on how a neural network alone could create consciousness or the illusion thereof either.</p>

<p>I would think that connectomes of brains each simulated in a very fast conventional  computer connected to the outside world with cameras and microphones and able to manipulate the outside world like robots would never be able to develop better scientific theories, but would devolve scientific theories, since they would have no way of judging the better theories from the worse, or if they had a way to judge in the beginning they would lose that ability more and more over time.</p>

<p>I speculate that what is happening is that the quantum fluctuations in brains are not random, that signals from higher worlds or parallel realms or universes are coming in all the time and are doing many things including making better and better scientific theories. Maybe dark matter is in other realms and we only feel the gravity but maybe we are also connected via quantum fluctuations and maybe higher intelligences reside there?:<br/><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4nnpg4N35o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4nnpg4N35o</a></p>

<p>Who else were mentioning a invisible parallel world? Plato did:<br/><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.trinity.edu/cbrown/intro/plato_two_worlds.html">http://www.trinity.edu/cbrown/intro/plato_two_worlds.html</a><br/>
Plato might not have been right about all the specifics, but he might have started a field of science, that in these times maybe have been abandoned by mainstream science, which may not be a good thing?</p>

<p>This way of improving scientific theories, by the influence of quantum fluctuations, could also work on beings living in the physical universe we observe around us that are 1 million or 1 billion years ahead of us in evolution. Evolution seems to over time  to produce more and more intelligent living beings. This is what we observe have happened on Earth. If that is true the quantum fluctuations should contain information enabling us to discover a science far beyond the science we now are aware of.</p>

<p>We have the Fermi paradox, why don’t we observe aliens? Maybe in a not so far future humans or what they have become may prefer to live in other parallel realms, maybe where there are less impediment to learn from what we in our realm describe as quantum fluctuations, that could be a shadow play of something far more important? Maybe we are not evolved enough to escape the capture of the physical universe we see around us? But soon we may be and so the transmission of radio signal from an intelligent species may not last for more than a few centuries, or they may find better modes of communication? But if some very highly evolved beings would voluntarily choose to live in the physical universe, why could quantum fluctuations not teach them in the time they use in the physical universe too?</p>

<p>There could be an enormous amount of information hidden in quantum fluctuations if only we could develop progressively better and better keys to decipher them?</p>

<p>There is a huge electric field over the cell membrane of each neuron and synapse in the brain (about 15.000.000 volts/meter ) and that could amplify the effects of quantum fluctuations in the cell membrane, I think? In a very strong electric field electron positron pairs would be created by quantum fluctuations and produce a current in the electric field generated and controlled by quantum fluctuations, but in a lesser electric field local charge inhomogeneities would be created and produce a current too, I think, and the quantum fluctuations could push on molecules transported in the ion pumps, influencing the precise time the neuron fires. Also the moment when a quantum tunneling event occur could be controlled and not just be random? In the many sodium-potassium pumps and sodium- and potassium-channels and elsewhere the signals in the brain will be influenced by quantum fluctuations, maybe sometimes as a butterfly can influence the weather, because of the butterfly effect?</p>

<p>But maybe the effect of quantum fluctuations is larger compared to the effect on the neural activity in the brain than the signals in the butterflies brains that form the weather some months ahead are to the effect of that weather or else it could be difficult to measure.</p>

<p>If the quantum fluctuations are controlled very precisely or at least in part, by a very advanced intelligence they could maybe be rather random looking but still animate a living being with an intelligence that improve scientific theories, and influence developments in small groups of people and the society as a whole, but I think they could not be completely random.</p>

<p>If one are on the moon or maybe in whatever galaxy, if one could get there we would still feel as if we are the same person and could maybe function as normal without much changes but maybe something new could also be added that are not solely dependent on the physical surroundings but maybe also on the nature of the Gods that generate the quantum fluctuations in that particular place? People themselves may be part of Gods?</p>

<p>There could be a God reigning over a field as large as the field of the natural laws we now know and can later be discovered and as long time as those laws exist?</p>

<p>The more compressed a computer file is the more random it appears to be to someone that does not have the key to decode it. I also believe to have read that the so far unknown digits in pi and e far out perhaps after the first googolplex digits will be indistinguishable from random digits if they were given to us. So what appears to be random may not actually be random.</p>

<p>I think the brain is not an advanced key enough to decode signals that, by using what technology can do today, are indistinguishably from completely random quantum fluctuations. I think that maybe quantum fluctuations can transmit information without changing any of the conserved physical quantities in a closed system except in very short periods of time. But that may be enough to animate a living being. Signals maybe also travel to higher parallel realms without altering any of the conserved physical quantities in a closed system, except when delta time is very small.</p>

<p>It were the quantum fluctuations in the very early universe that determined the large scale structure of the local galaxy group and probably also the Milky Way, so they can have an effect on the physical world:<br/>
We are amplified quantum fluctuations - YouTube <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltK8aR9uHW0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltK8aR9uHW0</a></p>

<p>Could there have been a deliberate plan behind how the quantum fluctuations manifested themselves in the very short time span, visible in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, that produced the large scale structures of the universe and the Milky Way, so that what was supposed later to have an opportunity to happen could happen? Is the quantum fluctuations always of such an intelligent nature and is there a Divine intelligence far beyond the human intelligence always working much much faster than the human mind and are we most of the time unable to perceive that?</p>

<p>Could there be a dynamically changing field of a very advanced intelligent nature in other parallel realms that are able to animate whatever have the structure in this universe so it can appear animated to us, like animals and humans?</p>

<p>HERE IS A METHOD TO TEST MY HYPOTHESIS:</p>

<p>Take a number of Zener Diodes in a Faraday cage and make an electronic noise channel for each of them, by letting a current flow in their reverse direction. Like that there will also be a high electric field ( about 30.000.000 volts/meter ) where the noise is generated inside the zener diode. So the noise here like some of the noise in the brain, are is also generated where there is a large electric field.</p>

<p>In the brain there are trillions of separate locations that can be influenced independently by quantum fluctuations and it is unclear to me how many zener diodes are needed and how small they need to be, in order to detect a clearly measurable effect of non randomness in quantum fluctuations, but it could be possible, because I don’t think the experiment have been done yet. Which could make such an experiment a remarkably low hanging fruit?</p>

<p>Digitise each zener diode noise channel with an AD converter after the noise have been amplified and feed those “noise” channels into a feed forward neural network whose weights are determined by using a genetic algorithm to evolve the weights in a population of networks.</p>

<p>An operator could for instance try to make a dot, controlled by the zener diode noise feed into the neural network, to behave like the operator intends.     With no, so far, known scientifically possible connection established between the person and the zener diodes.</p>

<p>While the operator is intending that the dot on the screen should move to the left the neural networks that moves the dot to the left using the zener “noise” channels, will be favoured in the simulation of natural selection of neural networks performed in the computer. The same procedure with all the other directions the dot can move in.</p>

<p>After a long time of training like this, maybe both the operator and the neural network may have evolved such that the operator can move the dot around on the screen simply by intending it, even though the zener diodes are isolated in a Faraday cage. A situation perhaps similar to the learning that takes place when humans are learning new skills, like moving their arm in different directions.</p>

<p>Another question is: How should the digitized amplified zener noise be presented to the neural networks? Maybe it could be beneficial to Fourier Transform the noise signal using FFT and convolute some of the zener diode noise signals together before the presentation to the neural networks?</p>

<p>WHY DON’T ANYONE PERFORM SUCH AN EXPERIMENT? I HOPE TO MAKE SUCH AN EXPERIMENT MYSELF BUT OTHERS WOULD HAVE MORE TIME AND RESOURCES TO GET ANSWERS FAST.</p>

<p>Is the above hypothesis true or false, using the scientific method?</p>

<p>I might add that some work may have been done detecting intentions small effect on matter already at Princeton:<br/><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.princeton.edu/~pear/experiments.html">http://www.princeton.edu/~pear/experiments.html</a><br/>

<p>COULD THE ABOVE DESCRIBED EFFECT IF ANY BE EVOLVED TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN OBSERVE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OTHER PARALLEL UNIVERSES AND MAYBE GO THERE OURSELVES (WE MIGHT BE THERE ALREADY?), MAYBE IF HIGH IQ PEOPLE BEGIN TO WORK ON THE TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS CAN BE MARKETED TO DRIVE THE INVESTMENTS IN THE TECHNOLOGY OR IF PRIVATE CHARITY OR GOVERNMENT FUNDS ARE USED TO INVESTIGATE?</p>

<p>I THINK THAT IF SUCH AN EFFECT IS THERE, ONLY VERY FEW CAN NOW TELL WHAT A TECHNOLOGY USING IT COULD EVOLVE INTO. Like in much basic science.</p>

<hr/><p>John Maynard Keynes bought many of the papers by Isaac Newton written in code and tried to decipher them. He discovered that Newton was very interested in religion and the occult. Maybe the occult is a too strong word because it does not appear that Newton yielded to outright superstition. My interpretation: Where else would maybe the most important scientist of all time have gotten his inspiration from, if not from the occult?</p>

Some missing parts can be seen here: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdmhPfGo3fE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdmhPfGo3fE</a></p>

<p>Maybe Newton's occult experiments were for proving how intervention from other worlds happens in this world? I don't know but I think he did not believe that everything was put in motion and the left to run without any external intervention. He believed in some divine intervention. Maybe a little bit like Einstein that did not like a mechanical universe with randomness added to it from Quantum Fluctuations?</p>

<p>Einstein liked inventing phrases such as "God does not play dice," "The Lord is subtle but not malicious." On one occasion Bohr answered, "Einstein, stop telling God what to do." But Maybe Einstein was right in that quantum fluctuations are not random?</p>

<p>Maybe Newton where looking for a life force in chemistry in the Diana's Tree <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana%27s_Tree">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana%27s_Tree</a></p>

<p>Maybe the technology in the time of Newton and Einstein were not capable to show what they wanted to show?<br/>
But now we may be on the brink of beginning to prove Newton and Einstein right in a big way? Right in the sense that there is an intervention from a higher forces or intelligences in the world.</p>

<p>Maybe electronics and computers can be used. Maybe Quantum Fluctuations are not the most random things that we know of.</p>

<p>Maybe one of the most harmful things in atheism is that there is no consequences that the thoughts and actions one had and did during the earthly life that can influence what happens after the earthly life. One is highly motivated by the prospect of earning money in the earthly life and one is likewise often keen to avoid what can cause later pain in the earthly life, like engaging in criminal activity that by the society have been deemed as punishable. Now if one believe there is no consequences after death, atheist leaders in atheist regimes can be some of the most brutal if they think they will avoid the retribution some may wish to inflict on them well while being alive on earth.﻿</p>
