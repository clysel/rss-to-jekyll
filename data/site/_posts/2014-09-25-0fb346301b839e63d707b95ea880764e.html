			<p>Santiago Cardenas from the Citrix Solutions Lab has written a blog post that caught my eye. It's entitled <em><a href="http://blogs.citrix.com/2014/09/10/scripting-automating-vm-operations-on-xenserver-using-powershell/">Scripting: Automating VM operations on XenServer using PowerShell</a></em>, and in it he describes how the Solutions Lab has been using the XenServer PowerShell SDK to automate XenServer deployments at scale. The thing I found most interesting was that he's included several example scripts for common operations, which could be very useful to other people.</p>&#13;
<p><span>If anyone else has example scripts in any of our five SDK languages (C, C#, Java, Python and PowerShell), and would like to share them with the community, please put a note in the comments below. We would love to link to more examples, and maybe even include them in the distribution.</span></p>&#13;
<p><span>PS </span><span>If you're interested in the PowerShell SDK, also check out </span><a href="http://xenserver.org/blog/entry/public-availability-of-xenserver-sdk-development-snapshots.html">the blog post</a><span> that Konstantina Chremmou wrote here in May describing improvements in the SDK since the 6.2 release.</span></p>&#13;
