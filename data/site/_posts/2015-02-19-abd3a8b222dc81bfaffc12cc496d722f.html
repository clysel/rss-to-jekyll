			<p>It's coming up on time for <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/vancouver-2015/">OpenStack Summit Vancouver</a> where <a href="http://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a> developers and administrators will come together to discuss what it means and takes to run a successful cloud based on OpenStack technologies. As in past Summits, there will be a realistic focus on <a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page">KVM</a> based deployments due to KVM, or more precisely <a href="http://libvirt.org/">libvirt</a>, having "Group A" status within the <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/HypervisorSupportMatrix">compute driver test matrix</a>. XenServer currently has "Group B" status, and when you note that the distinction between A and B really boils down to which can gate a commit, there is no logical reason why XenServer shouldn't be a more prevalent option.</p>&#13;
<p>Having XenServer be thought of as completely appropriate for OpenStack deployments is something I'm looking to increase, and I'm asking for your help. The OpenStack Summit organizers want to ensure the content matches the needs of the community. In order to help ensure this, they invite their community to vote on the potential merit of all proposals. This is pretty cool since it helps ensure that the audience gets what they want, but it also makes it a bit harder if you're not part of the "mainstream". That's where I reach out to you in the XenServer community. If you're interested in seeing XenServer have greater mindshare within OpenStack, then please vote for one or both of my submissions. If your personal preference is for another cloud solution, I hope that you agree with me that increasing our install base strengthens both our community and XenServer, and will still take the time to vote. Note that you may be required to create an account, and that voting closes on February 23rd.</p>&#13;
<h3>Packaging GPU intensive applications for OpenStack</h3>&#13;
<p>If you'd like to see the GPU capabilities of XenServer materialize within OpenStack, please vote for this session using this link: <a href="https://www.openstack.org/vote-vancouver/Presentation/packaging-gpu-intensive-applications-for-openstack">https://www.openstack.org/vote-vancouver/Presentation/packaging-gpu-intensive-applications-for-openstack</a>. The session will encompass some of the <a href="https://packer.io/">Packer</a> work I've been involved with, and also the GPU work XenServer is leading on with <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/virtual-gpus.html">NVIDIA</a>.</p>&#13;
<h3>Avoiding the 1000 dollar VM in your first cloud</h3>&#13;
<p>Â </p>&#13;
<p>This session covers the paradigm shifts involved when an organization decides to move from traditional data center operations to "the could". Since this is a technology talk, it's not strictly XenServer orientated, but XenServer examples are present. To vote for this session, use this link: <a href="https://www.openstack.org/vote-vancouver/Presentation/avoiding-the-1000-dollar-vm-in-your-first-cloud">https://www.openstack.org/vote-vancouver/Presentation/avoiding-the-1000-dollar-vm-in-your-first-cloud</a></p>&#13;
<p>Thank you to everyone who decides to support this effort.</p>
