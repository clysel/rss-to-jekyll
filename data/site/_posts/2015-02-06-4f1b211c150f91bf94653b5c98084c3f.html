			<p><span>We've got an important advisory for users who are trying the new </span><span>XenServer 6.5 release and would like to use the new </span><span>Space Reclamation feature (TRIM) <strong>on LUNs bigger than 2 TiB</strong>  as we have found an issue (inherited from upstream) which might result in data corruption of virtual disks under certain conditions such as high I/O.</span></p>&#13;
<p><span> In XenCenter, this functionality is labeled "Reclaim Freed Space" under the host's storage tab.</span></p>&#13;
<p><span>As you can imagine, investigation is progressing rapidly and is well on the way to identify both the root cause and the fix which will be made available via the usual channels as quickly as possible. </span></p>&#13;
<p><span>Note - this doesn't affect other functionality in the product that we're aware of at this time. </span></p>&#13;
