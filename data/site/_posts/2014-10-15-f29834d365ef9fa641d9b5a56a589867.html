			<h2>Maximizing Desktop Real-estate with Ubuntu</h2>&#13;
<p>With the addition of Ubuntu (and the likes) to Creedence, you may have noticed that the default resolution is 1024x768.  I certainly noticed it and with much work on 6.2 and Creedence Beta, I have a quick solution to maximizing the screen resolution for you.</p>&#13;
<p>The thing to consider is that a virtual frame buffer is what is essentially being used.  You can re-invent X configs all day, but the shortest path is to - first - ensure that that the following files are installed on your Ubuntu guest VM:</p>&#13;
<pre>sudo apt-get install xvfb xfonts-100dpi xfonts-75dpi xfstt</pre>&#13;
<p>Once that is all done installing, the next step is to edit Grub -- specifically /etc/default/grub:</p>&#13;
<p>sudo vi /etc/default/grub</p>&#13;
<p>Considering your monitor's maximum resolution (or not if you want to remote into Ubuntu using XRDP), look for the variable <strong>GRUB_GFXMODE</strong>.  This is where you can specify your desired BOOT resolutions that we will instruct the guest VM to SUSTAIN into user-space:</p>&#13;
<pre>GRUB_GFXMODE=1280x960,1280x800,1280x720,1152x768,1152x700,1024x768,800x600</pre>&#13;
<p>Next, adjust the variable <strong>GRUB_PAYLOAD_LINUX </strong>to equal keep, or:</p>&#13;
<pre>GRUB_PAYLOAD_LINUX=keep</pre>&#13;
<p>Save the changes and be <strong>certain </strong>to execute the following:</p>&#13;
<pre>sudo update-grub</pre>&#13;
<pre>sudo reboot</pre>&#13;
<p>Now, you will notice that even during the boot phase that the resolution is large and this will carry into user space: Lightdm, Xfce, and the likes.</p>&#13;
<p>Finally, I would highly suggest installing XRDP for your Guest VM.  It allows you to access that Ubuntu/Xbunutu/etc desktop remotely.  Specific details regarding this can be found through Ubuntu's forum:</p>&#13;
